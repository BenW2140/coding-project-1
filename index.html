    <h3>A Little Bit About Me</h3>
    <p>Growing up I always loved gaming, and as I got older I wanted to make
      my own games, except I never knew how or even where to begin with that.
      I never really did anything with programming until college, where I
      studied computer science for about 3 years. I decided to come to Epicodus
      after those 3 years because I felt like I wasn't getting anywhere with
      traditional school, so I'm here hoping to be able to get somewhere with
      my goals.</p>
